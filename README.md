# What is Jumpstart?
Jumpstart is a supplemental Magic booster set with mostly reprints and some new cards.

# What is this project?
A simple script that calculates your odds of collecting the themed lands by playing Jumpstart on Magic the Gathering: Arena.

# How to run?
Modify the top of the script to set your currency or collection preferences or run as-is for some sample output.
